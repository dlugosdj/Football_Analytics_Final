              <h2>Overview</h2>
              <p>
                This project shows defensive stats for the Mercyhurst Football team
                in the year 2025. It compares each defensive player's year-end stats
                and their average tackles for the year. It also compares the team's 
                stats for the selected week, and the opponent's team offensive stats
                for that week. The goal is to show how the defensive players finished
                the year and how the team's defense performed against each opponent.

              <h2>Web Scraping</h2>
              <p>Data was scraped off of the Mercyhurst athletics website, hurstathletics.com.
                  The specific page use was https://hurstathletics.com/sports/football/stats.
                  This page contained all the tables I scraped to get my data. Tools used in Python
                  included BeautifulSoup, Pandas and Requests.
              </p>

              <p>* Assistance from the Google Gemini AI tool within Google Colab was used to help generate
                  the web scraping code snippets shown above. Help was normally asked with statements 
                  like, but not limited to, "Simplify the code" and "Change the code to work without causing
                  errors".

            <section id="database">
              <h2>Database</h2>
              <p>The database created is consisted of three csv files. One containing Mercyhurst's
                 defensive player's stats, one containing the opposing team's offensive stats,and one
                 containing Mercyhurst's team defensive stats. All three were wed scraped from the
                 hurstathletics.com website, shown above. From that database, two other csv files
                 were created. One containing defensive player's average tackles per game and one
                 containing the opposing teams rushing and passing attempts compared to Mercyhurst's
                 total team tackles. The two csv files I created, along with the three original csv files,
                 where all used within my web app.
              </p>
              <p>*These are the SQL queries used to create the tables that make up my two csv files.</p>
              <p>-- Players Average tackle per game</p>
              <p>select col as '#', Player, TOT/GP as 'Average Tackles Per Game'</p>

              <p>where TOT/GP > 0.0</p>
              <p>order by TOT/GP desc;</p>

              <p>-- Yards/Attempt vs Total Tackles</p>
              <p>select opp.Date, opp.Opponent, opp.Rushing_YDS / opp.Rushing_ATT as 'Rushing Yards/Attempt', opp.Receiving_YDS / opp.Receiving_ATT as 'Receiving Yards/Attempt', team.Tackles_TOT as 'Total Tackles'</p>
              <p>from opponent_offensive_stats as opp</p>
              <p>inner join team_defensive_stats as team on opp.Date = team.Date</p>

              <h2>Web Application</h2>
              <p>This web application is broken into two tab, aside from the project overview tab.
                 The 'Mercyhurst Defense' tab shows two tables. 'Mercyhurst Defensive Stats (2025)'
                 contains all defensive stats from players who recorded defensive stats for the 2025
                 season. The 'Player's Average Tackles per Game' table shows the average tackels per
                 game for those players, sorted highest average to lowest. The 'Mercyhurst vs Opponent'
                 tab consists of three tables. The 'Opponent Offensive Stats' table shows the offensive
                 stats for each team Mercyhurst played against. The 'Mercyhurst Defensive Stats' table
                 shows the team defensive stats Mercyhurst has against each opponent. The 'Attempts vs
                 Mercyhurst Total Tackles' table compares the rushing yards per attempt and receiving
                 yards per attempt for each opponent against Mercyhurst's total tackles for that game.
                 Users can narrow their view using the controls provided allowing them to select just
                 one week at a time, or showing all weeks together. </p>
