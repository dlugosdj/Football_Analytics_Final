# Football_Analytics_Final

Files added in this workspace:

- `index.html` — main webapp entry (root). Contains sections: `Overview`, `Web Scraping`, `Database`, `Web Application`.
- `styles.css` — basic styles for layout and sections.
- `app.js` — minimal JS scaffold for future interactivity.

Quick preview

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or run a lightweight local server from the repository root:

```bash
# Python 3 built-in server (recommended for local fetches)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# then open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser
```

2. Edit the `Web Scraping`, `Database`, and `Web Application` sections in `index.html` as you develop features.
